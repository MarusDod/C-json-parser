#C-json-parser

JSON parser implemented in the C language (work in progress)

Configuring and compiling:
  git clone https://github.com/MarusDod/C-json-parser
  make

You can execute the program by

interpreting JSON text from the command line:
  ./jsonParser [1,2,3]

or running file script:
  ./jsonParser -f data.json

All it does right now is interpret the string and convert it back to text.
